## Hi there 🙋🏽‍♀👋

I'm currently studying .NET Cloud Developer at IT-Högskolan to become a master in full stack development.

I have worked a lot in the industry and see much that can be automated. My mind is curious and a bit lazy (in a good
way!), and that is why I am always looking to improve much of our workflows with technology. Which was what made me
start on this new journey.

If you are like-minded, I am always open to new opportunities, you are welcome to connect with me on my socials or if
you would like to get carried in Valorant, I can be generous... occasionally.
